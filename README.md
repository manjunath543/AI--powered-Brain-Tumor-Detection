# AI--powered-Brain-Tumor-Detection
🚀 Project Showcase: Neuro-Image Segmentation & Brain Tumor Detection
Built an AI-powered system to automatically detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images.
The model classifies scans into Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor using CNN.
Implemented image preprocessing, segmentation, and deep learning for accurate predictions.
Achieved 82.91% accuracy with real-time inference and confidence scoring.
Developed an end-to-end full-stack solution using TensorFlow, Python, Node.js, and SQLite.
This project demonstrates how AI can support radiologists with faster and reliable diagnosis.
